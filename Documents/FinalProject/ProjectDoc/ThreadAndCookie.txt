	For maintaining most viewed product, we have maintained cookies of user so that even same user view the product for many time
	then the viewed count for the user will be 1. Simply product view count willbe recorded if user are the different users.
	
	Similarly for decreasing the front display time, or to make page faster we have used background thread for interacting with database.
	
	for thread the libraries used are: 
	 
	javax.swing.SwingWorker;
